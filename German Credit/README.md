# German Credit dataset

This dataset (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Statlog+%28German+Credit+Data%29) containes 1000 rows of credit data and the rating "good" and "bad" for each row.

In this project i'm performing EDA and classification model in order to predict the rating.

NOTE - i took more simplfy dataset based on the UCI one from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/german-credit) 

NOTE - This project is a part of a course, so i'm limited to use only logistic regression and decision trees
